# üìÖ Java Exercise: Month Management with ArrayList and HashSet

## üìå Description

This project involves creating a class called `Month` with a `name` attribute, which stores the name of the month. The following tasks must be performed:

1. Create 11 `Month` objects (one for each month, **except "August"**).
2. Store these objects in an `ArrayList` in the correct order.
3. Insert the **"August"** month in its correct position (after July).
4. Convert the `ArrayList` into a `HashSet` to avoid duplicates.
5. Iterate through the list using:
   - A `for-each` loop
   - An `Iterator`

This exercise is useful for practicing with collections (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`), overriding methods such as `equals()` and `hashCode()`, and understanding how data structures work in Java.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java 17 or higher  
- IntelliJ IDEA (optional)  
- JDK (Java Development Kit)  
- Java Collections (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `Iterator`)  

---

## üìã Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- ‚úÖ Java JDK 17 or higher  
- ‚úÖ An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code (optional)  
- ‚úÖ Operating system: Windows, Linux, or macOS  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.  
3. Create a `Month` class with a `name` attribute, and override the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods.  
4. Create a `Main` class with the `main` method where you'll perform the required operations.  

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

1. Run the `main` method.  
2. You will see the following steps in the program output:
   - List of months without "August".  
   - List with "August" inserted in the correct position (position 7).  
   - Set (`HashSet`) without duplicates.  
   - Collection traversal using a `for` loop.  
   - Collection traversal using an `Iterator`.
